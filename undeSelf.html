                <h1 class="paragraphSpacing">Understanding The Self</h1>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Identify and justify the NEED (e.g. problem, current issues) to promote the chosen domain.</h2>
                <p>The support system from the public and private sectors is what we need in the software industry. I think there are many creative thinkers in the Philippines, but they weren't given the chance to express their creativity via innovation.</p>
                <p>Both the government and private sectors are essential in stimulating innovation, for example where Sitra, the public innovation fund, supplied early financing for Nokia, same goes with software developments in the country. These types of public investments are critical in creating and shaping new markets. We must also recognize that failure is inevitable and that practically every programmer has encountered it.</p>
                <p>Every week, there are new reports of software failures affecting a variety of businesses, causing havoc, stopping operations, or even costing lives. The only way I can come up with to promote software creation in this country is through social media. Social media networks enable you to engage with your consumers, raise brand awareness, and improve leads and sales for your new development in only a few short weeks. Social media use is a global phenomenon with around five billion users; thus, it is not a passing fad.</p>
                <p>We want to create a platform to promote our Filipino farmers to engage with their fellow farmers on their output and sourcing materials, government support, transporting their produce, and storage and expanding their market. We can improve our GDP by having more exports than imports and consumers can directly support Filipino farmers by being able to directly buy from the source.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Research your chosen cultural domain and heritage.</h2>
                <p>Software or a program helps us fulfill a specific task that we can perform with the help of a computer falls under the category of application software. Any web browsers, games, audio-video players and various others are known as application software. The world of application software is much bigger than our understanding. Different types of application software fulfill different kinds of user requirements.</p>
                <p>An application program is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself, typically to be used by end-users. Word processors, media players, and accounting software are some of its examples. It is costly to make a functioning one over time as it needs constant support, especially considering how many people intend to use many programs maliciously. Making a genuinely useful program would require a hefty amount of commitment, as it costs a lot of time and effort to make one, which influences people’s desire to make one for leisure.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">History</h2>
                <p>Tom Kilburn is responsible for writing the world's very first piece of software, which was run at 11 a.m. on June 21, 1948, at the University of Manchester in England. During the 1940s and 1950s, computers took up entire rooms and were so expensive that only universities and large companies could afford them. Most people were unfamiliar with the computer because of this, therefore keeping public interest low.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Enumerate and explain the challenges faced by your chosen domain.</h2>
                <p>The main challenge with software applications is that they do not have a broad audience because most of our apps are only intended for local use. For instance, the GCash app only serves one purpose and can only be used locally. We have never created an amazing app that can cater to a global audience and being able to address societal needs is crucial for figuring out how to make people's day-to-day lives easier.</p>
                <p>The second challenge is coming up with ideas for the game or software you will create, since we all know it is difficult to come up with ideas. You also need to be adaptable and listen to user feedback to improve your software or app.</p>
                <p>The third challenge is that, as I previously stated, there is no government support, and the primary reason for that is corruption. If a Filipino created a very useful software, there is a chance that the government officials will reject it if they cannot profit from it. No matter how incredible your accomplishment is, if the government cannot profit from you, they will not allow you to thrive. Additionally, I think that creating excellent software will attract a big user base and have a global impact. As a developer, you should consider the demands of the general audience and how your program may meet those needs.</p>
                <p>We have so many talented Filipinos with creative minds that end up working abroad. And while there are companies who accept these employees in the country, they don't make as much as the high in-demand jobs in medical or engineering fields, or even remotely close to how much other countries lend paychecks in these same jobs.</p>
                <p>Another challenge faced is that a lot of our target audiences, farmers, would be unable to access the internet, which would make it a challenge to make our applications available, since rural areas would very much have very little internet support.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Reflect on your facets of the Self (physical, material, sexual, digital, spiritual, political). Consolidate the members’ responses. Write NA if the facet is not applicable or related to your chosen domain.</h1>

                    <dt>Digital Self</dt>
                    <dd>The most effective way to promote digital interactive media is through social media. As of January 2022, there were 92 million social media users in the Philippines. We can use powerful strategies to hook their attention, especially as future IT workers, their user experience depends on the IT worker's skill. Besides social media promotion, we can also promote in many more ways such as publishing a blog, making our own promotion website, petition website, etc.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing">Political Self</dt>
                    <dd>Software can be promoted by people's political facets. Digital ballots are a thing in some countries that allow people to exercise their right as citizens to vote. This means there could be further use for digitizing processes in politics, which is our way of being able to promote digital interactive media, by making more effective digital alternatives to the older processes.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing">Material Self</dt>
                    <dd>Using the material self, we could promote digital interactive media through the personalization of day-to-day apps. Having software that you're comfortable with is great for helping people get attached to it, especially when you give people a way to express themselves with it that it becomes part of the thing that projects who they are. Like how messenger allows you to change the theme colours, so that it could look dark at night to be easy for the eyes, which makes people get more used to using the software.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>We can promote digital interactive media with the help of self-nurturing habits such as book reading, especially about how to influence people, leadership, and marketing. With that, we can level up our promotion skills and generate more ways to promote what needs to be promoted, especially in digital media interactive related such as software, apps, and even software businesses and employees. Additionally, we can also improve the quality of communication and influence so we can inspire young developers to express their creativity.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Specify your ROLE, RESPONSIBILITIES, and aspired CONTRIBUTION/S as Filipino citizens.</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Developer</dt>
                    <dd>It is the developer's duty to keep user data and information private and to be receptive to user feedback in order to make their program better. And make the app user experience friendly and multi-lingual and can be used offline.</dd>
                    <dd>Their contribution would be their ability to share their creativity through the app they made, fulfill its function, assist the user with day-to-day tasks, and help the country’s agriculture industry.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing">Influencer</dt>
                    <dd>It is an Influencer’s responsibility to care for their audience by watching out on what they promote to their followers. They also have their responsibility to be their own ideal self online, to foster people who will look up to them.</dd>
                    <dd>Their contributions would be their ability to use their audience to give notice to any problems the country is facing, or even with shouting out fellow locals, especially the Filipino farmers</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing">Game Changer Student</dt>
                    <dd>It is a student’s duty to carry the future of the country and its legacy as the hope of the new generation.</dd>
                    <dd>Their contributions would be to fill in the gaps in the labor force to help serve their country.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing">Politician</dt>
                    <dd>Politicians or government can contribute by helping and giving support to the developers and give them the opportunity to thrive.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Expound on what can be the connection of your cultural domain to any specific cultural heritage (tangible/intangible).</h2>
                <p>We aim to use technology and extend the reach of progress by using new methods of communication and application development to our Filipino farmers. We can revolutionize the traditional and cultural agriculture practices together with usual business and commerce prevailing in agriculture today towards the new e-agriculture. This will enable the farmers to improve their methods of farming and the sale of their produce by using the platform to increase their market and visibility, this will provide more inputs by crowd-sourcing, supplies, materials, skills and talents thereby substantially changing the landscape in agri-commerce.</p>
                <p>We aim to advance the Filipino farmer’s livelihoods, by digitizing the process to make it better for their lives. We can digitize the “palengke” culture that Filipinos have, so that farmers don’t have to wait outside of a stall in some rural area. This will make it so that consumers and customers could find fresh produce in the comfort of their home, while farmers could find customers without the need to walk 5 km everyday to the nearest palengke just to sell their goods. We could also improve the market’s visibility and viability, by enabling options like being able to crowd-source, supply materials and equipment, hire other skilled individuals, to help prepare better goods with one another, changing the ways farming would be looked upon in the Philippines in this new era of E-Agriculture.</p>
