                <h1 class="paragraphSpacing">Science, Technology & Society</h1>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Building on the reasons you identified on why you need to promote your chosen domain in Pocket Project 1, what would be the impact of the promotion of that cultural domain on the general public, specifically the underprivileged Filipinos?</h2>
                <p>Promoting our industry (Digital Interactive Media â€“ Software Applications) would have a huge impact on the general public and underprivileged Filipinos since it not only gives them advantages they didn't have but also inspires people to pursue their ambitions even more by showing them that their dream of being a great software developer is achievable, like what we discussed with Understanding the Self, we should make an app that will connect farmers to consumers, which will have a significant impact on both the general public and underprivileged. It will also help to promote and improve agriculture in the country. Promoting this domain will increase the number of job opportunities available to the underprivileged.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Building on the challenges faced by your chosen domain that you identified in Pocket Project 1, propose detailed and workable solutions using science and technology to address those issues.</h2>
                <h3>Here are some practical approaches to addressing the issues that our cultural domain faces:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since our subject of expertise is software applications, we can use science and technology to learn about what the needs of the public are and then work to meet them. For instance, in the Philippines, we can support the development of our agricultural sectors by putting farmers and consumers in direct contact with one another via our app. Additionally, by utilizing technology, we may quickly connect with users who are located elsewhere and attract additional followers and users. Social media can also help attract users with the help of influencers to promote Filipino software applications since their audiences already trust them, they will probably buy from them as long as it is valuable.</li>
                    <li>We should provide our graduates and software developers the chance to work in the country and develop a better software application, and the government should also support these individuals in developing the apps that the people need. One of the other issues our field faces is that most graduates or creative minds end up leaving the country and working overseas due to the high wage. As a result, the country will be left behind by the foreign tech giants.</li>
                    <li>One of our cited challenges is our limitations of being a local app, meaning our services are going to be mostly limited to our own country. Our proposal to this is simply to grow. By having the application grow, we could garner interest in countries out of our international sea, which would allow us to expand our services there, once it is both capable and has enough foreign interest.</li>
                    <li>Another one of our challenges is the competition and obsolete of our technology. As you know, technology improves over and over, and one of the problems is that not everyone has technology that is up to date, creating this gap where a lot of the consumers would have a gap between the versions of an app that must be created separately for each. At first, it was a simple difference between a cellular phone and a smartphone, but later on even smartphones would have a gap between other smartphones in terms of compatibility.</li>
                    <li>Our proposed solution is to have those terminals, that those convenience stores have for buying loads, but placed in the more rural areas, allowing people with more outdated tech to still have access to newer versions of software that can be very useful to them. Another solution is to seek government assistance in receiving funding for acquiring up to date technology to be used by the people.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Building on your answers on the importance of your chosen cultural domain to our community and society in Pocket Project 2, how can we further democratize the accessibility of these domains to the underprivileged Filipinos?</h2>
                <p>Our aim is to empower the youth of those in dire situations by giving better IT education, in order to help children with their situation to realize the vision of an internet that everyone from the world all over could access. To fulfill the potential of those who lack the means to do so, we would have to involve all of society to make a change using the experiences of everyone, from the government to large businesses and even all functional citizens, to make a change together to make a greater world to live in.</p>
                <p>Technology and education becomes the single greatest catalyst for sustainable and scalable economic and social impact progress, at personal, community, national and international levels.</p>
                <p>Poverty is an issue that needs to be addressed as well, with programs that provide work opportunities for students, and more generally government support in education for the underprivileged Filipinos as well as providing access to resources such as facilities, etc.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Incorporating everything you have done from Pocket 1 and 2 up to this point (background, history, challenges, accomplishments/milestones, impacts, solutions, and democratizing access), create a proposal on how you would utilize your chosen cultural domain to improve the lives of underprivileged Filipinos.</h2>
                <p>Digital marketing is one strategy that can be applied to either earn, promote or help the needy persons. Digital marketing can reach its advertisements to various people, organizations or societies who are interested in donations or conduct various programs for the needy people.</p>
                <p>A good example that this could apply to is an organization known as FundRaiser, where they collect money to give aid to those in need. This could make very good use with digital marketing to further boost awareness would give better help all around. There are many similar platforms and techniques where we can connect with companies, as well as individuals who can help poor people and expect nothing in return. Digital marketing can be a medium to help the poor, you can use this medium wisely to help someone need it.</p>
                <p>With further breakthroughs in communication technology, applications like Zoom and Skype have made it possible to connect with friends and loved ones alike from all over the globe, allowing people to keep in touch no matter where they are. Because of communication technology, both children, who can take classes online, and parents, who can work online, can spend more time together. This would also allow the parents to better care for their children, being able to involve themselves in their child's growth as any parent should, while still being able to work for their family.</p>
                <p>There is even potential for more jobs, as technology always needs some form of maintenance, which would provide engineers more kind of work in the Philippines to hopefully reduce the likelihood of brain drain by enticing students with a good career here.</p>
                <p>With digital banking, transactions are now made easier, checking one's account balance or even making transfers just with a single click on their phones or other digital devices. With software applications like GCash, Paymaya, BDO Pay, Paypal and so forth. Banking is made easier and more accessible to more people. Adding to that, with the help of software applications and the coming of the digital era, banking transactions can be done digitally, and therefore be a much faster process for everyone else. This can not only speed up the process, but can also save a bit on fuel for everyone since they would no longer have to keep commuting to the bank, which has the inadvertent effect of lowering the pollution in the country; a double win.</p>
