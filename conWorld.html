                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">More than the background and history from the previous project, write down the accomplishments of this domain both in the local context and international context.</h2>
                <p>Famous programmers can be found in many corners of the world, and the Philippines is one such country that has an abundance of intellects including coders. The proliferation of programming and information technology has rapidly encouraged many young Filipinos to select programming as a future. As a result, many competent programmers have emerged in the last few years.</p>
                <p>A recent accomplishment in software programming is by INFOR PSSC inc, by having served 90000+ companies worldwide using their knowledge of handling businesses and the use of their software, which helps businesses manage themselves. They have won the ICT award for Best Software Development and Information technology Company of the Year.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Write down what are notable milestones of this cultural domain that puts our focus to this category.</h2>

                    <dd>An app that I would consider a milestone to software programming. It's an app that helps you get to your destination by finding commuting vehicles near you that are heading towards that place. I say that this is a milestone as it is an app that is similar to the concept of our app, which is making a platform for users to find service professionals easier.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://lawjuan-constitution-ios.soft112.com/">LawJuan</a></dt>
                    <dd>A database app that helps Filipinos look for law sources, and current legislation in the Philippines. It compiles it all so that up and coming lawyers would have an easier time accessing archives worth of materials needed. This would be a milestone as it is one of the few apps that is successful at helping professionals, which is why we think this domain needs more attention.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.gcash.com/business/">GCash</a></dt>
                    <dd>The Philippines was, and maybe is still, a country where a majority of its citizens have no access to a bank (Hilario, 2022). This has greatly changed with the introduction of GCash, which allows so many Filipinos to have access to digital banking, which made online transactions so much more accessible to a lot of people. With this kind of effect, it is safe to say that GCash is a programming milestone as it is one of the first digital portal for banking in the Philippines.</dd>
                    <dd>Hilario, E. (2022, May 19). Number of unbanked Filipinos decreases as digital finance supports daily needs. Manilla Bulletin.</dd>

                    <dd>A service that gives a platform for drivers to find work, while also making it easily accessible for customers who are in need of their service. It hosts a variety of services related to the transportation industry, but there was a problem, its services were not available in the Philippines.</dd>
                    <dt class="descriptionSpacing"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.grab.com/ph/">Grab</a></dt>
                    <dd>A company called Grab filled such a role, helping drivers find work, and helping customers find labor. The way grab changed the country was massive as the Philippines as it was still a developing country, lacking many public services. Because of its impact and its model, Grab acts as a key milestone in the software programming domain, as it is a very successful digital service that hosts the platform that allows labourers to connect with consumers a lot easier.</dd>
                    <dd>Grab (2019, June 10). 7 years of Grab in Southeast Asia: Grab announces significant milestones across its super app services. Grab PH.</dd>

                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">With the impact of these accomplishments and milestones, how has this cultural domain become important to our community and society?</h2>
                <p>Gaining recognition for our efforts will increase customer loyalty and user numbers. Additionally, because all of our works and initiatives will be highlighted as a result of these accomplishments, our market will expand.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of smartphones in the world, and those smartphones have a lot of applications.</p>
                <p>With apps, you can connect to the entire world. They are your partner in everything, including communication and enjoyment. Applications certainly have made your life easier and more enjoyable.</p>
                <p>These apps enable us to place orders for things whenever we want, from any location, and to track their progress from order acceptance to delivery. We may also see the history of our transactions. These applications also make it simple to transfer money from one account to another. We can assist Filipino farmers in selling their products through these applications, and we can also collaborate with another app called GRAB or Transportify, an app that can transport goods from one location to another. These applications also assist farmers in showcasing and advertising their products online.</p>
                <h2 class="paragraphSpacing">Expound on the effects of globalization as a driving force and a hindrance to promoting your cultural domain.</h2>
                <p>Globalization would be beneficial to promoting our cultural domain because it encourages free trade and without borders creating trade restrictions there would be a free flow of goods and services. A hindrance of globalization would be that it may encourage more offshoring. The threat of sending jobs to different and cheaper counties overseas may be used to defend lower income domestically. The effect of abolishing borders would lead to higher salaries to developing nations and lower wages in already developed countries.</p>
                <p>Software applications have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are used in almost all the fields of work, from banking and finance to healthcare and education. However, globalization has helped us to reach out to people across the world, thereby bringing them closer together. This has also made it easier for us to access information about these products, but at the same time it has created challenges for us as well. For example, if we want to sell our product abroad then we need to make sure that it meets all the cultural norms there so that it appeals to their taste buds as well as their wallets. On top of that we have to ensure that the product is cost effective enough so that people will be able to afford buying it even if they don't have much money at hand. Another challenge is keeping up with all the latest updates and adding more features over time so that our customers don't feel left out by any new developments in technology or business models being introduced by competitors who are using similar methods for getting their products out there on various platforms around the world.</p>
                <p>Globalization also increases our competition, as there are several apps available that can assist farmers in selling their products. Since many farmers lack tech skills, we should make the app easier for them to use. We can also seek farmers for feedback on the app, and we should also speak with the farmers organization to convince them to endorse it. The license is also a problem, as is the other issue of acquiring approval from other nations so that they can purchase our items internationally. We also cannot prevent other customers from purchasing goods from other countries.</p>
